# EV-Powertrain-Model
Model for EV powertrain created during workshop, results compared with workshop standards
## Overview

This project simulates the behavior of an EV under specific conditions, as built in the workshop. The results show extreme scenarios where 20-30% of the battery is consumed over a short distance.

## Files

- `ev.slx`: The Simulink model file.
- `README.md`: This file.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `ev.slx` in MATLAB Simulink.
3. Run the simulation to observe the results.
