EV Model Replication - Tata Nexon
This repository contains a MATLAB Simulink model replicating the Tata Nexon EV's performance under various driving conditions. Developed during a hands-on workshop, the project simulates real-world EV behavior, focusing on energy consumption and battery performance.

Overview
Objective: Simulate and analyze the Tata Nexon EV's performance under different drive cycles.
Key Features:
Detailed EV model in Simulink.
Simulations for NEDC, WLTP, and Urban Indian drive cycles.
Analysis of battery SoC and energy consumption.
Prerequisites
MATLAB R2020b or later
Simulink
Simscape Driveline
